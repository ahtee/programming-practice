### Computer Science Concepts to Master
Master approaches to programming problems by knowing when to use Recursion and also what Data Structure is best to solve the problem.

- Recursive Functions (Top-Down algorithms).
- Iterative Algorithms (Bottom-Up algorithms).

`Note: Recursive function can be done iteratively by including Stacks or Queues, but is more difficult to solve.`

#### Traversal
- Tree Traversal
- Graph Traversal 

Pre-Order, In-order, and Post-order traversal. You should also know how to write Depth First Search and Breadth First Search traversals.

`Note: Try using a Data Structures to represent a Tree, as an alternative to Nodes (Array, for example)`

#### Binary Search Trees

- Create a Tree
- Balance a BST

#### Stacks and Queues
- Know the methods: push, pop, peek. The order LIFO Stack, FIFO Queue.

#### HashMaps, Hashtables, ...
    
#### Object-Oriented Programming
Show you can create structure
- Classes
- Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort, Quicksort
- Divide and Conquer Strategies

#### String manipulation
    
## Dynamic Programming :point_left:
- Memoization
