Practice programming problems for Software Engineering Roles (Frontend). 

## Introduction

This document is to track my own progress of understanding software engineering concepts. Fundamental algorithms and data structures:

- [ ] Breadth-first search 
- [ ] Depth-first search 
- [ ] Hash tables 
- [ ] Lists 
- [ ] Binary trees

...as well as their runtime characteristics and common applications.

### Languages

  - [Ruby](/ruby/README.md)
  
### Computer Science Concepts to Master
Master approaches to programming problems by knowing when to use Recursion and also what Data Structure is best to solve the problem.

- [ ] Recursive Functions (Top-Down algorithms).
- [ ] Iterative Algorithms (Bottom-Up algorithms).

`Note: Recursive function can be done iteratively by including Stacks or Queues, but is more difficult to solve.`

#### Traversal

- [ ] Tree Traversal - In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order.
- [ ] Graph Traversal - Using stacks?

Pre-Order, In-order, and Post-order traversal (this section). You should also know how to write Depth First Search and Breadth First Search traversals (Table of contents). 

`Note: Try using a Data Structures to represent a Tree, as an alternative to Nodes (Array, for example)`

#### Binary Search Trees

- Create a Tree from an array (`are there other Data Structures we can create trees from? Linked Lists?`)
- Balance a BST

#### Stacks and Queues
- Know the methods: push, pop, peek. The order LIFO Stack, FIFO Queue.

#### HashMaps, Hashtables, ...
    
#### Object-Oriented Programming

Show you can create program structure.

- Classes
- Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort, Quicksort
- Divide and Conquer Strategies

#### String manipulation
    
## Dynamic Programming :point_left:

- [ ] Memoization

. For frontend positions, we emphasize expertise programming for the Web (including an understanding of modern JS tooling and cross-browser compatibility issues) and sensibilities for design and UX over a strong algorithmic or CS background.
