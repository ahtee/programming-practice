Practice programming problems for Software Engineering Roles (Frontend). 

## Table of Contents

This document is to track my own progress of understanding software engineering concepts. Fundamental algorithms and data structures: 
  - Breadth-first search 
  - Depth-first search 
  - Hash tables 
  - Lists 
  - Binary trees

...as well as their runtime characteristics and common applications.

### Languages
  - [JavaScript](/javascript/README.md)
  - [Python](/python/README.md)
  - [Ruby](/ruby/README.md)
  
### Computer Science Concepts to Master
Master approaches to programming problems by knowing when to use Recursion and also what Data Structure is best to solve the problem.

- Recursive Functions (Top-Down algorithms).
- Iterative Algorithms (Bottom-Up algorithms).

`Note: Recursive function can be done iteratively by including Stacks or Queues, but is more difficult to solve.`

#### Traversal
- Tree Traversal
- Graph Traversal 

Pre-Order, In-order, and Post-order traversal. You should also know how to write Depth First Search and Breadth First Search traversals.

`Note: Try using a Data Structures to represent a Tree, as an alternative to Nodes (Array, for example)`

#### Binary Search Trees

- Create a Tree
- Balance a BST

#### Stacks and Queues
- Know the methods: push, pop, peek. The order LIFO Stack, FIFO Queue.

#### HashMaps, Hashtables, ...
    
#### Object-Oriented Programming
Show you can create structure
- Classes
- Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort, Quicksort
- Divide and Conquer Strategies

#### String manipulation
    
## Dynamic Programming :point_left:
- Memoization

. For frontend positions, we emphasize expertise programming for the Web (including an understanding of modern JS tooling and cross-browser compatibility issues) and sensibilities for design and UX over a strong algorithmic or CS background.
